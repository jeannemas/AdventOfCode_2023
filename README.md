Advent of Code 2023 solutions

Don't forget to download your input files and place them in the `days/<DAY>` folder for each day! The file is generally expected to be named `input.txt`.

The solutions are provided in Typescript, and are meant to be ran with Deno.

> Note: Be aware that the solutions are not meant to be fast or efficient, but rather to be readable and easy to understand.

```bash
# Run a solution
deno run --allow-read=./days/<DAY>/input.txt ./days/<DAY>/part<PART>.ts

# Run tests for a particular day
deno test ./days/<DAY>

# Run all tests
deno test
```
